    ">- Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again.\n",
    ">- Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.\n",
    ">- We may call the function and reuse the code contained within it with different variables rather than repeatedly creating the same code block for different input variables.\n",
    ">- **Syntax:** The syntax to declare a function is:\n",
    "                def function_name(arguments):\n",
    "                        \"\"\"Docstring\"\"\"\n",
    "                        # function body \n",
    "                        return\n",
    ">- **Parameters:**\n",
    "                    def :- keyword used to declare a function\n",
    "                    function_name :- any name given to the function\n",
    "                    arguments :- any value passed to function\n",
    "                    docstring :- short explaination about fucntion's working\n",
    "                    return (optional) :- returns value from a function\n",
    "\n",
    "> **`Rules for Defining a Function:`**\n",
    ">- Function blocks begin with the keyword **`def`** followed by the **`function name`** and **`parentheses ( ( ) )`**.\n",
    ">- Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.\n",
    ">- The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - **`the documentation string of the function or docstring`**.\n",
    ">- The code block within every function starts with a **`colon (:)`** and is **`indented`**.\n",
    ">- The statement **`return [expression]`** exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as **return None**.\n",
    "\n",
    "            \n",
    "> **`Advantages of Functions in Python:`**\n",
    ">- By including functions, we can prevent repeating the same code block repeatedly in a program.\n",
    ">- Python functions, once defined, can be called many times and from anywhere in a program.\n",
    ">- If our Python program is large, it can be separated into numerous functions which is simple to track.\n",
    ">- The key accomplishment of Python functions is we can return as many outputs as we want with different arguments."
